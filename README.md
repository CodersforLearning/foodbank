# Foodbank

A web application aiming to educate young children about healthy eating habits and food groups

## Available Scripts

Please have yarn installed on your computer to run the project the intended way. Also make sure the line endings for the project are `lf` to reduce any possible bugs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

NOTE: The .env file containing API keys for Notion hasn't been uploaded to the repository. Therefore some pages will not work when run locally (view Vercel deployment instead).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

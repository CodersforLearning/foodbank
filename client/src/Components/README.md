# Components

To keep the UI consistent throughout the app, any custom components built should be abstracted and placed here.

For example, if we want a button component, we create a folder `Button` and add the files as shown below

```bash
Components
├── Button
│   ├── index.test.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── TextField
│   ├── index.test.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
└── README.md
```
